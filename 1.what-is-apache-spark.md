# what is Apache Spark

apache spark is a unified computing engine and a set of libraries for parallel data processing on computer clusters. spark supports multiple widely used programing languages(Python, Java, Scala, and R), includes libraries for diverse tasks ranging from SQL to streaming and machine learning, and runs anywhere from a laptop to a cluster of thousands of servers.

spark's toolkit

* high level kits
  * structured streaming
  * advanced analytics
  * libraries & ecosystem
* structured APIs
  * datasets
  * dataframes
  * SQL
* low-level APIs
  * RDDs
  * distributed variables

spark core engine itself has changed little since it was first released, but the libraries have grown to provide more and more types of functionality. spark includes libraries for SQL and structured data(spark sql), machine learning(MLlib), stream processing(spark streaming and the newer structured streaming), and graph analytics(graphX).

spark itself is written in Scala, and runs on the JVM, so to run spark either on your laptop or a cluster, all you need is an installation of java.
